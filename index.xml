      <description>&lt;p&gt;Info about the craziest personal project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, I submitted a project for the Develop at Ubisoft Toronto competition. It was a simple isometric, local multiplayer game that I had crunched over a couple of days to complete. I was not overly proud of it. It was a lazy attempt just to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though I was entirely confident of my skills as a programmer and felt as though I nailed the interview, this project was a mess. Coming in second place was not a massive surprise; I certainly hoped for a different outcome, but I was aware that I needed to push myself further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
